# temple-run-hand-gesture-controller
 This AI-based Python project uses MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking, OpenCV for image processing, and PyAutoGUI to simulate keyboard inputs. Swipe gestures move the character left, right, jump, or slide â€” and making a fist pauses/resumes the game. No hardware, just pure gesture magic!
